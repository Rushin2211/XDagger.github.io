<h1 id="were-almost-there">We’re Almost There!</h1>

<p>October has been a great month for XDAG community, awesome growth in our Telegram and twitter community.
 We’re glad to have an increased number of community supporters, it’s showing more users and prospects are getting to know and ready to adopt XDAG. 
 We just want you to know that, we appreciate your support and commitment.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/photo_2020-10-30_07-20-41.jpg" alt="Thanks Community image" /></p>

<h1 id="exchange-listing">Exchange Listing</h1>

<p>We’re still in talks with several exchanges so xdag can be listed, since we all know a new exchange is what all our community wants. Hopefully we get good feedback from them.</p>

<h1 id="technical-update">Technical Update</h1>

<h2 id="xdags-bip44-universal-code-is-586">XDAG’s BIP44 universal code is 586!</h2>

<p>Thanks to the efforts of community enthusiasts, XDAG now finally has its own BIP44 cointype 586!</p>

<p>So what is the BIP44? Why does XDAG need BIP44?
 To understand BIP44 we have to mention the HD wallet. Since there are so many cryptocurrencies nowadays and they are not easy to manage when one user has too many private keys, the HD wallet was created, and its function is that one master private key can generate multiple sub-private keys, that is, one HD wallet can be used to manage multiple cryptocurrency accounts and only one master private key needs to be backed up, and when the user has multiple blockchain assets (BTC, ETH, XDAG, etc.), the user can manage them in one HD wallet, this is much more convenient. 
BIP44 is the standard private key management protocol used by HD wallets, XDAG has now joined the BIP44 protocol with a common standard code so that HD wallets can support the management of XDAG address accounts.</p>

<p>Obtaining this standard code will facilitate further alignment of XDAG with BTC and ETH, which has many potential benefits for the future development of XDAG:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enables multi-chain wallets to support XDAG</li>
  <li>Enables XDAG to back up private key files using mnemonics.</li>
  <li>Facilitate professional teams to manage XDAG wallet hierarchically.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="randomx">RandomX</h2>

<p>Random X development is done, when it is fully reviewed we are going to launch it with the next update.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/photo_2020-10-30_07-20-40.jpg" alt="almost there image" /></p>

<p>Briefly let talk about the “October effect” Bitcoin’s apparent effect has given more impression to still be the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and daily trading volume. 
Xdag also hit a new ATH price up too in the month of October, which is a very great edge for the community, we’re almost there, it’s only a matter of time XDAG adoption will surely be global.</p>

<p>We remain committed, focused and as a community project with you all continuous support we’re going to have the XDAG of our dream.</p>

Exchange Listing

We’re still in talks with several exchanges so xdag can be listed, since we all know a new exchange is what all our community wants. Hopefully we get good feedback from them.

Technical Update

XDAG’s BIP44 universal code is 586!

<h3 id="why-xdag-choose-java">Why XDAG choose Java:</h3>

<p>We want our community to experience something more different than C, we understand the power behind huge community support and we’re committed to make bigger implementation.</p>

<p>Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the most popular programming language in the world</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy to learn and simple to use</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also an open-source and its free</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is secure, fast and powerful</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The above are the reason why  we took advantage of the java version so our community can benefit.</p>

<p>Lastly with the new implementation of XDAG in Java will call out for more developer to join our community. Together we can achieve a lot as a community project.</p>

XDAG is based on DAG

XDAG is a novel application of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology that solves the issues currently facing blockchain technology.

The DAG chain and XDAG has numerous benefit that makes it unique, suitable for everyone around the world more than a blockchain based cryptocurrency.


A brief explanation of what DAG is about.

What is DAG?

DAG (directed acyclic graph) is a directed graph with no directed cycles, that uses a topological ordering. DAG is an alternative method for sending data amongst people within a distributed, decentralized environment. This is done without a blockchain, allowing for greater scalability.

As we all know Dagger is part of a new wave of Distributed Ledger projects based on a DAG infrastructure which directly implies it has numerous benefit using DAG technology on XDAG platform which include the following;

TRANSACTIONAL SPEED

Since XDAG is a DAG-based cryptocurrency it’s capable of handling hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. It increases the speed and stability of transactions as the user network grows. Since the passing of information is not limited to one chain but can be pass in a parallel allowing more than one chain to exist at any time.

INCREASE RELIABILITY

The mechanism of multiple transaction confirmation in cryptocurrencies based on DAG allows to increase the reliability of payments and reduce the chance of “double spending” 
Since the DAG network only need verification of two close nodes this will surely ensures the reduction of costs for all users on the network.

DECENTRALIZED

XDAG is the decentralized and first minable DAG cryptocurrency, which has technology’s sequential solution and increased efficiency.
Block = transaction = address
Original main chain idea
Mining new money every 64 seconds. XDAG is both CPU &amp; GPU mineable.

SECURITY

FRIENDLY ECOSYSTEM

DAG-chain transactions are conducted without any physical mining and are therefore far more energy efficient. That’s because every transaction is validated by the transaction itself, cutting costs to network users as well as cutting down on energy consumption.

Lastly scalability and prompt timing on the execution of smart contract, also makes DAG network very beneficial to XDAG platform and we know we’re the future of cryptocurrency.

Issue 1, 2020

XDAGers, we meet again.

The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 hit the “pause button” for many economic activities, but the pace of XDAG’s progress was not interrupted. After completing the production cuts, enthusiasts are pressing on with the Apollo program. Recent development has been around the RocksDB storage revamp, with a new version to be released after testing is complete.

RocksDB version introduction

Historical Issues:

For historical reasons, the node needs to reload data into memory every time it reboots, rebooting the node takes at least 20+ hours (before version 0.3.1, it took about 7 days to reboot), and takes up a lot of memory, hard disk, etc. The problem is a serious constraint on the expansion of community consensus.

In response to this issue, the community has completed development work on the RocksDB version, resolving the reload issue:


  Data will be written into RocksDB from memory;
  Drastically reduce the memory consumption of the mining pool (about 300M).
  The full-node wallet (mining pool) reload time is reduced to seconds.

See introduction above.


  Mining algorithms to address mining equity issues


The old versions: SHA256D mining algorithm, which has a large number of professional mining machines, has led to a concentration of hash power in the hands of few people, which is far from the “fairness” that the community seeks, the adoption of a fair algorithm is the voice of the entire XDAG community.

Older versions: messy dnet code, complex multi-threaded logic.
